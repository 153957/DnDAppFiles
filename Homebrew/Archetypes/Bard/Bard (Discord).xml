				<name>Bard College: College of Discord</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Discord yearn to take the performances to the next level. While some artists feel the need to prepare or learn progressions within a harmonic framework, the extemporaneous nature of the bard’s study encourages inventing variations in their musical repertoire mid performance. This practice usually bleeds into their outlook on life and, whether with accompaniment or solo, these bards are excited to delve into the unknown, no matter the vibe.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Bonus Proficiencies</name>
				<text>When you join the College of Discord at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and one additional musical instrument.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Melodic Mayhem</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use your musical instruments effectively in martial combat. When you wield your musical instrument in one or two hands, and no other weapons, it becomes a weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the versatile (1d8) property. When used in one hand, it gains the  nesse property. Wielded with two hands, your Armor Class increases by 2.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Firearm Properties</name>
				<text>Reload</text>
				<text>The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload number before the wielder must spend 1 Attack of your Attack Action, or an Action, to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm. </text>
				<text>Misfire</text>
				<text>Whenever the Firearm is fired in a way that requires an Attack Roll, if the dice roll is equal to or lower than the Misfire number, the weapon Misfires, the attack misses, and it cannot be used to attack again until an Action and successful Tinker's Tools Ability Check (DC = 10 + Firearm's Misfire Score) is used to repair and clear the weapon. Should the Tinker's Tools check fail, the weapon is considered broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the weapon (or DM's discretion).</text>
				<text>Scatter</text>
				<text>An attack is made against each creature within a 30 ft cone. If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage on a hit.</text>
				<text>Explosive</text>
				<text>Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer half damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</text>

				<name>Gunslinger: Additional Deeds</name>
				<text>Quick Draw:</text>
				<text>Starting at 7th level, the Gunslinger gains +2 Initiative and can draw and stow Firearms as a free Flourish.</text>
				<text>Violent Shot:</text>
				<text>Starting at 7th Level, the Gunslinger can spend 1 or more Grit points before rolling an Attack. For each Grit point spent, that Attack gains +1 to the weapon's Misfire number. If the attack hits, it deals an additional dice of Firearm damage per Grit point spent. If the attack misses, Grit points are still expended. (ex: 3 Grit points = +3 to misfire, +3d[Firearm Damage Die]). Weapons with multiple damage dice add only 1 die per Grit spent. (ex: a 2d12 gun adds +1d12 per Grit)</text>

If the Gunslinger has multiple attacks for their Attack action, they can make multiple Targeted shots for 1 Grit point each. Your Trick Shot DC is 8 + your Proficiency Mod + your Dexterity Mod.</text>
