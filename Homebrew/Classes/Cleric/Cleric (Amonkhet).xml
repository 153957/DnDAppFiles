		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Domain: Solidarity</name>
				<text>Oketra is charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife. And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Solidarity Domain: Solidarity’s Action</name>
				<text>Also at 1st level, when you take the Help action to aid an ally’s attack, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Solidarity Domain Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</text>

		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Solidarity Domain: Oketra’s Blessing</name>
				<text>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Solidarity Domain: Supreme Healing</name>
				<text>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</text>

		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Domain: Strength</name>
				<text>It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlife—but to his mind, the words themselves don’t matter. Strength can’t be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see</text>

		<name>Cleric (Bontu Ambition)</name>

		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Domain: Ambition</name>
				<text>Bontu has fully embraced this dictum, and though she expends little effort in teaching it, she surely leads by example. Her viziers subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires. Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one’s place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate’s determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Ambition Domain: Warding Flare</name>
				<text>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between your- self and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to  are before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.</text>
				<text>	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

				<text>	As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</text>

				<name>Ambition Domain Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows</name>

				<text>The God-Pharaoh expects those he welcomes into the afterlife to desire it above all other pleasures and achievements, and for them to show their dedication, passion, and fervor through their actions. Hazoret is charged with cultivating this zeal in the initiates who come under her care, and she has undertaken the task with appropriate enthusiasm.
