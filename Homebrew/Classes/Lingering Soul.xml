				<name>Spirit Binding</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, you must select an object or creature of your choice (it could be an heirloom, weapon, or ally) to bind to indefinitely. You must remain within 150 feet of your bound target at all time, and if the object or creature leaves your 150 foot radius, you are dragged along with it. You are always aware of where your bound object or creature is in relation to you.</text>
				<text>	Should the object be destroyed, or the creature slain, you immediately drop to 0 hit points. If you regain Consciousness without a spirit bond, you must immediately select a new object or creature within 150 feet to bind to. If nothing is present to bind to, you are paralyzed until an object or creature comes within 150 feet for you to bind to.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Phantom Calling</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level, you select a Phantom Calling that defines the path of your spiritual journey. Choose Poltergeist, Wraith, or Spirit Guardian, all detailed at the end of the class description. The calling you choose grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 11th, and 15th level.</text>
				<text>	The Phantom Calling you select will define one of your Ability Scores to carry over from life as the characteristic that now defines you in undeath, called your Aspect. The ability modifier form this ability score also acts as your Aspect modifier in regards to Lingering Soul features.</text>
				<text>	Some of your Lingering Soul features require you to make an Aspect attack, or your target to make a saving throw to resist a feature's effects. The modifier and saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text>	Lingering Soul save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Aspect modifier</text>
				<text>	Aspect Attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Aspect modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Ghostly Form</name>
				<text>At 1st level, your physical body is no more, your new, spectral form existing in the space between realms. You gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text>• Your creature type is Undead, and you are considered undead in respect to all spells, abilities, and effects.</text>
				<text>• You give off a cold glow equal to dim light for a 5 foot radius.</text>
				<text>• You cannot physically carry any objects or wear equipment. You also no longer need to eat or drink, nor gain the benefits of any objects or substances that require ingestion.</text>
				<text>• While you are not possessing a creature. you have damage resistance against bludgeoning. piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</text>
				<text>• You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</text>
				<text>• You are immune to the prone, grappled, restrained, and petrified conditions.</text>
				<text>• You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.</text>
				<text>• You fall at a rate of 60 feet per round, and do not suffer falling damage.</text>
				<text>• You still take short or long rests per usual to use hit dice and regain the use of abilities, but do not require sleep.</text>
				<text>• Should you fall to 0 hit points, you begin fading. You are considered unconscious, and make death saving throws as normal. Should you fail three death saving throws, your spirit withers away into the ether. Your soul is cast into the vaults of the underworld and cannot be recovered or resurrected outside of the use of a Wish spell.</text>
				<text>• Should you ever be brought back to life via a spell or resurrection effect, you immediately lose all levels in Lingering Soul and return to life as your previous, living self. You gain back class levels in your original classes as they were upon death, plus one additional character level per level of Lingering Soul gained while playing as a spirit.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Possession</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you discover the ability to enter the bodies of other creatures and influence their actions. As a bonus action. you can attempt to possess one creature within 5 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become possessed. A creature can fail this saving throw voluntarily.</text>
				<text>	Wile possessing a creature, your body occupies the same space as the host and is not visible. You cannot be targeted or affected by any attacks or spells, but you suffer damage equal to half of any damage dealt to the host while possessed. If the host moves, you move with them. You can only experience what the host sees and hears, and can communicate with them telepathically. You can only use features that specify their use while possessing a host.</text>
				<text>	A possessed creature acts as normal on its turn. However. you can use your action to force the possessed creature to make an immediate weapon attack against a target of your choice within range, adding your Aspect modifier to the damage dealt. You can instead use your action to force the possessed creature to Dash in a direction of your choice, or to the Dodge action.</text>
				<text>	This possession lasts until the host drops to 0 hit points, you drop to 0 hit points, or you are forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell or turn undead ability. You then reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature. You can choose to end your possession for free at the start of your turn. The host creature is immune to your possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the possession saving throw or after the possession ends (unless the creature wishes otherwise).</text>
