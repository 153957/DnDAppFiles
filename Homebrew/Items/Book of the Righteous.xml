		<text>Made from the feather of an angel, the celestial quill shines with the perfect light of Heaven, emitting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that distance. An evil creature that willingly touches a celestial quill takes 10d8 radiant damage, and the limb that touched it becomes permanently withered and useless, the effects of which are determined by the GM. The withering can be reversed by a wish spell.</text>
		<text>	Any other creature can touch and use the quill. If used as a writing implement, it cannot be used to write any untruth. Furthermore, when used to create spell scrolls to contain cleric or paladin spells, the quill halves the creation cost (see DMG for details on creating magic items).</text>

		<text>Eliwyn still grows in her sacred grove. Once every century, she sheds her leaves. Most of them are gathered by the druids tending her. Some, though, are carried away on the wind and reach mortal hands beyond. These leaves are imbued with life-giving and healing powers. The leaves are large and oval, about twelve inches long and six inches at the widest point. The tops of the leaves are deep green while their undersides are bright silver.</text>
		<text>	A leaf has several possible uses. First, as an action, you can crush the leaf, which causes it to emit a sweet odor and ooze milky sap that functions as six potions of healing to anyone who consumes it. Second, as an action, you can apply the leaf to the body of one creature you can reach, which causes the creature to be instantly cured of any disease, poison, curse, madness, or any other harmful ongoing effect. Finally, you can use the leaf in place of the material components required by the raise dead, reincarnate, resurrection, or true resurrection spells. When you do so, the target su ers no ill effects from coming back from the dead. Using the leaf in any of these ways consumes its power.</text>

		<text>While carrying one of the staves, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and resistance to spell damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Spell Storage</text>
		<text>Each of the staves can store spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wielder uses them. A staff can hold up to 15 levels’ worth of spells at a time. Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the staff by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff cannot hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the spell slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. While holding the staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but otherwise is treated as of you cast the spell. Once cast, the stored spell leaves the staff, freeing up space to store another spell.</text>

		<text>Spells</text>
		<text>While holding the staff, you can cast each of the following spells once per day using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: dispel magic, geas, and teleport.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You become so attuned to the scents of the world around you that you can detect subtle changes in your environment no one else would notice. While you hold the staff, you are constantly under the effects of the following spells: detect poison and disease, find traps, and see invisibility. You are also aware of the location of each creature and plant within 30 feet of you such that creatures within this range cannot hide from you. You count as if you do not need to breathe for the purpose of resisting certain attacks and spells such as stinking cloud. Finally, you add stinking cloud and cloudkill to the list of spells you can cast once per day from the staff.</text>

You cannot be blinded and you are immune to gaze attacks such as the medusa’s Petrifying Gaze. Finally, you add eyebite to the list of spells you can cast once per day from the staff.</text>

Furthermore, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing, while creatures making checks against your passive Perception do so with disadvantage. You are immune to thunder damage. Finally, you add sending and thunderwave (as a 5th-level spell) to the list of spells you can cast once per day from the sta .</text>
