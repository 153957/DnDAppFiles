		<text>These bat-like wings affixed to a pole are constructed out of either bone and leather or wood and cloth. While these wings are opened and the rung of the pole stepped into, you can use an action to cast levitate on yourself at will.</text>
		<text>	Additionally, you can use an action to cast fly on yourself for up to 1 minute (no concentration required). The fly spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest, or you (and the Skysail) are immersed in extremely powerful air elemental magic, such as the top of the Summit Peaks near the Rift of Air in Zephrah, or within the Elemental Plane of Air. When not in use, these wings can be easily folded together and worn beneath a cloak, and the pole used as a quarterstaff.</text>

		<text>Oloore Root began as a druidic ceremonial tool for vision quests and communion with nature, but has become sought after by high society for its psychedelic properties. Drinking of the tea brewed from the root leads to heavy hallucinations, and sometimes grants insight to the world around them.</text>
		<text>	The imbiber must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or become poisoned for 1d4 hours. Upon a success, the imbiber gains advantage on any Wisdom ability checks for 1 hour.

		<text>Zeal is distilled from the blood of captured or slain quaggoth deep from beneath the surface of Exandria. When brewed properly, a thick, purple-colored liquid that tastes of ash remains.</text>
		<text>	Drinking zeal or applying liberally to exposed skin (requiring an action) forces the user to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12) or become paralyzed for 1d4 rounds as every muscle seizes up. With a success, the user deals an additional 3 damage to any target it hits with a melee attack for 2d6 rounds. THe user suffers 1 point of exhaustion after the effect ends, regardless of saving throw success. (valued at around 150 gp per dose)</text>

		<text>Suude is a dangerous, granular substance refined from magic residuum. Initially developed during the Age of Arcanum by archmages as an incense burned to enhance long spell ritual casting, the secret was discovered and spread among the spellcasting riffraff of Exandria. The varying forms of refinement are dangerous, and can produce one of three different types of suude.</text>
		<text>	When burned and the fumes inhaled (requiring an action), the imbiber must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) or become unconscious for 2d4 rounds. With a success, the user gains 1 Sorcery Point and access to one Metamagic option (as per the Sorcerer class Font of Magic and Metamagic features) for 1 hour based on the type of suude used. If more than one dose of suude is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 3 per additional dose. If three or more doses are used within 1 hour of each other, failing the Constitution saving throw drops the user to 0 hit points. Brown suude grants the Extended Spell option, Blue suude grants the Twinned Spell option, and Red suude grants the Distant Spell option. (valued at around 80 gp per dose)</text>
