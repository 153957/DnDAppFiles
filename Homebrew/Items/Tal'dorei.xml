		<text>These bat-like wings affixed to a pole are constructed out of either bone and leather or wood and cloth. While these wings are opened and the rung of the pole stepped into, you can use an action to cast levitate on yourself at will.</text>
		<text>	Additionally, you can use an action to cast fly on yourself for up to 1 minute (no concentration required). The fly spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest, or you (and the Skysail) are immersed in extremely powerful air elemental magic, such as the top of the Summit Peaks near the Rift of Air in Zephrah, or within the Elemental Plane of Air. When not in use, these wings can be easily folded together and worn beneath a cloak, and the pole used as a quarterstaff.</text>

		<text>Suude is a dangerous, granular substance refined from magic residuum. Initially developed during the Age of Arcanum by archmages as an incense burned to enhance long spell ritual casting, the secret was discovered and spread among the spellcasting riffraff of Exandria. The varying forms of refinement are dangerous, and can produce one of three different types of suude.</text>
		<text>	When burned and the fumes inhaled (requiring an action), the imbiber must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) or become unconscious for 2d4 rounds. With a success, the user gains 1 Sorcery Point and access to one Metamagic option (as per the Sorcerer class Font of Magic and Metamagic features) for 1 hour based on the type of suude used. If more than one dose of suude is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 3 per additional dose. If three or more doses are used within 1 hour of each other, failing the Constitution saving throw drops the user to 0 hit points. Brown suude grants the Extended Spell option, Blue suude grants the Twinned Spell option, and Red suude grants the Distant Spell option. (valued at around 80 gp per dose)</text>

		<text>This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies.
			<text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following properties.</text>
			<text>Corrosive Submission</text>
			<text>When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, you may force it to take an additional 3d6 acid damage and it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you for up to 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while charmed, the acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charm ends. It cannot be charmed again for 24 hours after the charm is ended in this way.</text>
			<text>Hidden Nature</text>
			<text>The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage; Any creature who is successfully charmed by it is under the illusion that the damage to it was merely an admonishing jostle. A true seeing spell or similar reveals that this sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.</text>
			<text>Sentience</text>
			<text>Graz’tchar is a sentient evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  e weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically.  ose who hold it hear the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny.</text>
			<text>Personality</text>
			<text>Graz’tchar slowly attempts to sway the character into sowing chaos in Tal’Dorei, telling lies about great leaders, claiming that the heads of the Tal’Dorei Council are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison. Should the wielder continue to disobey the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, it can attempt to charm the wielder. They must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 14). On a success, they are immune to the sword’s charm for 24 hours. Upon a failure, they become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. During this time, the sword can force the character to take an action of its choice once an hour, the wielder accepting this action as their own will. Should the chosen action lead to the harm of a non-hostile creature or ally, the charm immediately breaks.</text>

		<text>Type: Heavy Crossbow</text>
		<text>This shadow-touched hand crossbow once served as the weapon of choice for the legendary assassin Todora. You have a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional 1d8 poison damage.</text>
		<text>	If you hit with an attack using this weapon, instead of dealing damage, you can choose one of following effects to trigger: A fog cloud spell centered on the target, a silence spell centered on the target, the target can be affected by a hold person spell (spell save DC 17), or the blight spell (spell save DC 17). You can use each effect once, and cannot use them again until you finish a short rest.</text>
		<text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use.</text>
