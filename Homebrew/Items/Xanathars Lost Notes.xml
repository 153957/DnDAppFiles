		<text>This mithral longsword is of elven design, bearing runes along the blade that read "Arelind", an ancient elven word that means “Champion of the People”. These blades were often gifts given by elven wizards to non-elven allies of great esteem.</text>
		<text>	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. It sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius when unsheathed. You can speak, read, and write the elven language so long as the sword is on your person.</text>

		<text>This appears to be a simple, unassuming black leather belt when wrapped around the user’s waist. When removed, a small diamond can be seen stitched into the belt’s underside. Each time this belt is buckled, it sounds like a sword being drawn from a sheath. As part of an attack, you can draw a hidden +2 dagger from the belt. If the dagger leaves your hands it ceases to exist at the end of your turn. The belt doesn’t run out of daggers. You must be wearing the belt to use this property.</text>
