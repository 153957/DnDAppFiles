The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

• Protection – When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. 
	These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat>

	<note><name>Fighter</name><text>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. 
	Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor.
	Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. 
	This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</text><expanded>0</expanded></note><imageData><uniqueID>1021</uniqueID></imageData></character></pc>
