		<feat><name>Martial Arts</name><text>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. 
	You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: 
		• You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. 
		• When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
		• You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the following table:
		•Monk Martial Arts Damage Table

		<feat><name>Ki</name><text>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki (though other names exist, such as: prana, mana, chi, megin). 
	This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. 	Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies&#39; physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. 
	Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.
	Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness this mystic energy.  
	Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various features.
	You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

	When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. 
	Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 
	•Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat>
		<feat><name>Flurry of Blows (Ki)</name><text>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat>

		<feat><name>Unarmored Movement</name><text>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. 
	At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
	This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the table below:
	•Monk Unarmored Movement Table

		<feat><name>Deflect Missles</name><text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack.

	•If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

	Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees.

		<feat><name>Shadow Arts (WoS)</name><text>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells.

		<feat><name>Way of the Four Elements (Monastic Tradition)</name><text>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. 
	When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.
	Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat>
		<feat><name>Disciple of the Four Elements (WotFE)</name><text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.
	You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
	Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.
	Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. 
	To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.
	Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. 
	The spell&#39;s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

	<note><name>Monk</name><text>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&#38;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. 	The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. 
	Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families. 
	Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power. 
	The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants. 
	For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. 
	Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. 
	As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.
	Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
