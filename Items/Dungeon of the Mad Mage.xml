		<text>The box's interior is lined with thin sheets of lead to thwart certain forms of divination magic, including the detect magic spell. Inside the box is the dry, withered heart of a tiefling wizard. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of necromancy magic around the heart, while an identify spell or similar magic reveals its magical properties. A creature that has a heart in its own body can attune to the withered heart as though it were a magic item. When it does so, the withered heart switches places with the attuned creature's living heart, which has the effect of killing the creature instantly. The creature's living heart then withers and dies, and it gains the same properties as the tiefling's heart, allowing it to be passed on in the same way.</text>

		<text>The circlet transforms its attuned wearer into an attractive human of average height and weight. The circlet chooses the physical characteristics of the form, such as age, gender, skin color, hair color, and voice. Except for size, the wearer's statistics and racial traits don't change, nor do items worn or carried by the wearer. Removing the circlet ends the effect.</text>
