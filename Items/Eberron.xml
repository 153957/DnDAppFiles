Thinking of a particular phrase or topic will draw you to the first section that addresses it, and a simple ritual allows you to add content to the shard.</text>
		<text>	A wizard can use a spellshard instead of a spellbook; the spellshard costs 1 gp per “page” in the shard, and otherwise functions as a mundane spellbook. Spellshards can also be used as diaries or journals. More advanced (and uncommon) shards can require a particular mental passphrase to access the contents of the shard.</text>

This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. It also negates the effects of any manifest zone within the field.</text>
		<text>	Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches, as relics of the conflict between the Gatekeeper druids and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It’s said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be serious consequences for the world.</text>

The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, and if they create a spell sink it will be a living artifact—a twisted tree that consumes the mystical energies around it. Conversely, a mad artificer would create a massive vessel of dragonshards and exotic metals. It might be that the sole purpose of the device is to negate magic, or it could be that it is absorbing all magical energies in the area and storing that power for a cataclysmic effect!</text>

You gain the following benefits while you are attuned to a storm spire.</text>
		<text>• You can sense weather patterns within a 100-mile radius of the spire and accurately predict the weather for up to 24 hours</text>

		<text>• While you are within 5 feet of the spire, you can cast control weather as a ten-minute ritual. This allows you to pick a point within 100 miles of the spire and influence the weather within a 10-mile radius of that point. Maintaining this effect requires concentration</text>
		<text>• You can also use an action to influence the weather within a ten-mile radius of the spire itself; you don’t have to use concentration to maintain this effect, and you can sustain this at the same time that you’re manipulating distant weather</text>

		<text>A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. When you attune to a docent, the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life—literally.</text>
		<text>	Sentience. A docent is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It can perceive the world through your senses.</text>
		<text>	A docent communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant.</text>
		<text>	Personality. A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it’s attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent’s properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you... or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.</text>
		<text>	The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the  rst warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen’drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators... but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen’drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it’s possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.</text>
		<text>	Languages. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elvish and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen’drik may have never encountered a dwarf before... but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarvish language.</text>
		<text>	Properties. A docent possesses up to three of the following properties:</text>
		<text>• The docent can cast the detect magic spell at will.</text>
		<text>• The docent can cast the detect evil and good spell at will.</text>
		<text>• The docent can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting it and its warforged host.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Nature) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.</text>
		<text>You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its properties on your behalf.</text>

		<text>Requires Attunement</text>
		<text>A wand sheath is designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged. If you’re a warforged, you can attach an wand sheath by attuning to it. While the wand sheath is attached, it cannot be removed from you against your will. You can spend one minute to end the attunement and remove the wand sheath.</text>
		<text>	You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. While the wand is sheathed, you gain the following benefits.</text>
		<text>• You can retract the wand into your forearm or extend it from your forearm as a bonus action. While it is retracted, it cannot be damaged or removed.</text>
		<text>• While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free for other actions.</text>
		<text>• If the sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand only count as a single item for purposes of the maximum number of items you can be attuned to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, you immediately lose your attunement to the wand.</text>
